# 🎨 Emotion Sense Front-End

This is the front-end for the **Emotion Sense API** built with **React** and **Vite**, and deployed on **Netlify**. The application allows users to input text for **sentiment analysis**, determining whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.

🌐 **Live Demo**: The front-end is live and accessible at [Emotion Sense Front-End](https://emotion-sense.netlify.app/).

🚨 **Important Note**:  
The API used in this application is not always available online due to cost limitations 💸. When the API is offline, the app will default to using `localhost` for API requests. To try out the full functionality, you can clone the API repository and run it locally.
